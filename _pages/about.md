I am a 4th-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at North Carolina State University, advised by [Dr. Jiajia Li](https://fruitfly1026.github.io/) and [Dr. Xu Liu](https://xl10.github.io/). My research focuses on GPU performance analysis, profiling, and optimization.

## Research Interests

My research lies at the intersection of high-performance computing, GPU architecture, and system performance optimization. I specialize in:

- **GPU Performance Analysis & Profiling**: Developing novel dynamic binary instrumentation tools to identify performance bottlenecks in GPU applications
- **Memory System Optimization**: Detecting and eliminating redundant memory operations and improving memory access patterns
- **Heterogeneous Computing**: GPU/CPU co-scheduling and system-level performance optimization
- **Compilation & Code Generation**: Building bridges between AI ecosystems (Triton) and traditional HPC codebases

## Recent Highlights

- **SC 2025**: Our paper "RedSan: Redundant Memory Instruction Sanitizer for GPU Programs" has been accepted to SC 2025
- **Summer 2025 Internship**: Research intern at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), working on deploying AI infrastructure in HPC applications
- **Service**: Serving on the Junior Program Committee for SPAA 2025 and Artifact Evaluation Committee for PPoPP 2025

## Technical Skills

**Programming**: C/C++, Python, Shell

**Parallel Computing & Architecture**: CUDA (PTX, SASS), OpenMP, Triton, ROCm, GPU Architecture

**Profiling & Analysis Tools**: Nsight Compute/System, NVbit, CUPTI, Compute Sanitizer API, HPCToolkit

**Research Focus**: GPU/CPU co-scheduling, Memory redundancy detection, Dynamic binary instrumentation
